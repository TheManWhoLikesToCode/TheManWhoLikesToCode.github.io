The Spotify-Recommendation-System is a project called SpotiFind, that aims to provide personalized song recommendations based on audio features obtained from the Spotify Web API. By leveraging machine learning techniques and K-means clustering, this system groups songs with similar characteristics and suggests new tracks that align with users' musical preferences. The project SpotiFind is a practical implementation of the concepts discussed in the paper "Audio Feature K-Means Cluster-Based Song Recommendation" by Jaydin Freeman.
