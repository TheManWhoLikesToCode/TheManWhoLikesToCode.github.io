Blackboard Scrapper is a Python-based tool specifically designed for Kettering University students to efficiently archive and manage their course materials and grades from Blackboard. By leveraging Selenium for automated login and web navigation, along with Beautiful Soup for parsing web content, it extracts detailed course information and organizes it for easy access and long-term reference. The tool features two main functions; one that downloads all available course content (`scrape_content_from_blackboard`), and another that retrieves grades for each assignment and generates an HTML file for display (`scrape_grades_from_blackboard`). Note: Development on this project is currently paused as I no longer have access to Blackboard.
