Hi there! My name is Jaydin and I am a junior at Kettering University, where I am studying computer science with a concentration in artificial intelligence. I am very passionate about using technology to solve problems and make a positive impact in the world. In my free time, I enjoy staying up to date with the latest developments in the field and learning new programming languages and frameworks. On my Github portfolio, you can find a selection of projects that showcase my skills and experiences in the field of computer science. Thank you for visiting my page and I hope you find something interesting!
